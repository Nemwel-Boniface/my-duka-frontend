# My Duka front end

My duka Frontend is a front end for an application that aims to be an inventory management system. The application will also have an admins dashboard where only the admins and those given permission will be able to edit, delete or add inventory. By default, all users can be able to see the inventory that is available in the store.


The application will be built on the Ruby on Rails framework on the backend and React and Redux for its front end.


The link to the back end can be found [here](https://github.com/Nemwel-Boniface/my-duka-backend)
